<p>This is a repository where the readers can find some interesting and fun works related C++ stuff.
At the moment, the directory structure is pretty simple but as repository grows, I intend to make
it sorted out.  For the time being, users may find works related to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>benchmarking marking</li>
  <li>design patterns</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-its-reader-friendly-">How itâ€™s reader friendly ?</h3>
<p>Well, what Iâ€™m also trying out is to make it seamless for the readers/users to build things with minimal of efforts.
Iâ€™m making use of CMake build system generator and Conan packages along with some helper scripts in order to
allow building of Cpp stuff easy and re-usable.</p>

<p>Follow the other sub-pages to find details related to various Cpp works available currently.</p>
