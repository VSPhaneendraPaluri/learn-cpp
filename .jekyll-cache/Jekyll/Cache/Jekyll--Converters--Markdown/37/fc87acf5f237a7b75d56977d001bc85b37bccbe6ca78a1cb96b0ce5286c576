<p>This is a repository where the readers can find some interesting and fun works related C++ stuff.
At the moment, the directory structure is pretty simple but as repository grows, I intend to make
it sorted out.  For the time being, users may find works related to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>benchmarking marking</li>
  <li>design patterns</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-its-reader-friendly-">How it’s reader friendly ?</h2>
<p>Well, what I’m also trying out is to make it seamless for the readers/users to build things with minimal of efforts.
I’m making use of CMake build system generator and Conan packages along with some helper scripts in order to
allow building of Cpp stuff easy and re-usable.</p>

<p>Follow the other sub-pages to find details related to various Cpp works available currently.</p>
