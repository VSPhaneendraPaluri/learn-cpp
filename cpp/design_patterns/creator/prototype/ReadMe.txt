## Some Important Notes on Prototype Pattern

- Isn't based on inheritance but rather on the principle of delegation
- When the objects to be initialized differ only in the way they are initialized
- When the objects to be created are very much similar, differ by configurations
- When the code need not depend on the concrete classes of objects for copy
- Instead of subclassing the matching configuration, clone an appropriate prototype

## Features
- Can be sometimes simpler to a "Memento" design pattern
